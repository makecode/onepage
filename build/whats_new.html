          <h1>What’s new</h1>
          <p>VLC media player (commonly known as just VLC) is a free and <a href="#">open-source portable</a> cross-platform media player software and streaming media server developed by the VideoLAN project. VLC is available for desktop operating systems and mobile platforms, such as Android, iOS, iPadOS, Tizen, Windows 10 Mobile and Windows Phone. VLC is also available on digital distribution platforms such as Apple's App Store, Google Play and Microsoft Store.</p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>VLC supports many audio and video compression methods and file formats, including DVD-Video, video CD and streaming protocols. It is able to stream media over computer networks and to transcode multimedia files.</p>
          <p>The default distribution of VLC includes many free decoding and encoding libraries, avoiding the need for finding/calibrating proprietary plugins. The libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project provides many of VLC's codecs, but the player mainly uses its own muxers and demuxers. It also has its own protocol implementations. It also gained distinction as the first player to support playback of encrypted DVDs on Linux and macOS by using the libdvdcss DVD decryption library.</p>
          <h3>Operating system compatibility</h3>
          <p>VLC media player is cross-platform, with versions for Android, BeOS, iOS, macOS, tvOS, OS/2, Unix-like, Syllable, and Windows.[12] However, forward and backward compatibility between versions of VLC media player and different versions of OSs are not maintained over more than a couple or so generations. 64-bit builds are available for 64-bit Windows and other OS:</p>
